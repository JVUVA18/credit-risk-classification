In this project, two linear regression models were developed and evaluated. Both models utilize the same solver, but they are trained on different sets of data. The ML programs produced from these models have shown incredibly high accuracy in predicting the given challenges.

The first model was trained on unprocessed data. When the program was trained and tested aiit scored a balanced accuracy score of around 95%. This performance is considered quite good for a machine learning model. However, when the second model was trained on balanced data, it achieved an even hgiher accuracy score of 99%. This significant improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of using balanced data for training. This achievement is undoubtedly impressive, as the program now demonstrates an approximate accuracy of 99%. However, this remarkable level of accuracy raises concerns about potential challenges associated with the introduction of the RandomOverSampler method.

While the program appears to be approaching near-perfection, it's important to consider the implications of relying solely on the ML predictions. Labeling it as an "Almost guarantee" might lead to overconfidence and neglect the possibility of errors or inaccuracies in the ML model. This is particularly crucial when applying such a program in a financial institution where even minor errors can have significant consequences.
